# mlpp

This repository provides modular C++ implementations of classical machine learning algorithms with an emphasis on clarity, efficiency, and extensibility. 

## Overview

The library includes supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, model validation tools, clustering methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, and supporting mathematical utilities. Each module is designed to operate independently and expose a concise interface.

## Design Principles

The codebase follows a minimal-dependency philosophy, relying primarily on the C++ standard library and a set of self-contained headers. The structure prioritizes transparency, predictable performance, and mathematically explicit formulations.

## Building

The project uses CMake. The library can be built as a standalone target or integrated into other CMake-based projects through the provided configuration files.
